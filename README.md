# Inbox Unbox

A game about pushing boxes into other boxes. Inspired by [sokosoko](https://juner.itch.io/sokosoko).

This is a very early demo build; I've made a lot of progress since then! Don't go sharing this page please!

The full game is coming to [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1552300/Inbox_Unbox/) later this year! More info on [my site](https://pancelor.com/inbox-unbox)

**Don't look through the code if you don't want spoilers!**
